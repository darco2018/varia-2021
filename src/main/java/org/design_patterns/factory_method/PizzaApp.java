/* When to Use Factory Method Design Pattern
the Factory Method design pattern is used to create objects related to a single family.
the Abstract Factory Design Pattern is used to create families of related or dependent objects.

- When the implementation of an interface or an abstract class (here: Product.class) is expected to change frequently
- When the current implementation cannot comfortably accommodate new change
When the initialization process is relatively simple, and the constructor only requires a handful of parameters*/
